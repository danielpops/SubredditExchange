# SubredditExchange
SubredditExchange seeks to be a brokerage for friends to share their favorite subreddits.

The aim is to do so securely and with great respect for personal information, storing as little as possible, and sharing only what is intended by the user.  

SubredditExchange is built on Python 3 and Flask.
